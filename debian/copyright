It is released under GPL: under Debian systems see /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL,
with following additional condition:
If you want to use, redistribute, modify, abuse and molest grc in any
way, and you feel like it, you may add any clause to the license, as
long as it does not put any additional responsibility for behaviour of
this program at me and at least one of these conditions is met:

 - the resulting license fulfills Debian free software guidelines
   (http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines)
 - Richard Stallman has nothing against the new license, neither
   against running grc with any version of python available
   at the time of adding the clause
 - the resulting license brings peace and happiness to the world
