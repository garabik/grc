===================================================================
Requirements:
Anything with a python interpreter, with more or less work needed
if it is not unix.

If you have a debian system with all necessary packages installed, type
	dpkg-buildpackage (or dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot) in the package's
	directory, then type
	dpkg -i ../grc*deb

else:

	1) copy conf.* files into /usr/share/grc/ or /usr/local/share/grc/,
	   creating directories when needed

	2) copy grc.conf into /etc/

	3) copy grc and grcat somewhere to your path

	4) read the README and manual pages

	5) modify /etc/grc.conf if you feel like it


	There is a small shell script called install.sh provided, which
	automatically does the above steps.

If you're on OS X and using Homebrew,
	brew install grc
